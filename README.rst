Standard Seawater
=================

This project provides a small C++11 library for calculating the chemical
composition of seawater given a practical salinity.

The composition is based on the six most important (by reference salinity)
materials dissolved in *Standard Seawater*, according to F. J. Millero et al.,
Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 55.1 (2008), pp. 50-72.
These materials are sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, chlorine, and
sulfate ions.
